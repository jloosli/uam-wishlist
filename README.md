User Access Manager -> Wishlist Member Converter
================================================

## Instructions

To convert pages, posts, categories, and users from User Access Manager to Wishlist Member:

1. Install and active this plugin
2. Type in your wordpress url and type in ?runit at the end (e.g. http://example.com/?runit)
3. Wait for this to complete (can take a long time...you might need to set your PHP to run much longer)
4. Deactivate and uninstall Plugin

Keep in mind that this plugin will delete all current wishlist member levels.

### Extra

* If you end up having problems deleting levels, I've found that deleting the option_name of "wpm_levels" in wp_wlm_options works
* Plugin layout based on hlashbrooke's Plugin Template: https://github.com/hlashbrooke/WordPress-Plugin-Template/
